I am a planetary scientist and currently a postdoc at ISAE-Supaero, Univerisi√© de Toulouse. My research is currently focused on using machine learning to study planetary environments. This targets both the structure and dynamics of the atmosphere and the interior of planets. 

I am a science team member of the NASA Perseverance and InSight missions to Mars. Currently I am the co-lead of the atmospheric science working group on Perseverance. 

**Work history**
- 2023-2025 CNES (French Space Agency) Fellowship held at ISAE Supaero on "A machine learning framework for geophysical and atmospheric monitoring in planetary missions"
- 2020-2022 Postdoctorant at ISAE Supaero working with Raphael Garcia, David Mimoun and Naomi Murdoch on the NASA InSight and Perseverance missions
- 2019-2020 Research Associate at Imperial College London on the NASA InSight mission
- 2014-2019 PhD at Imperial College London "Latent variable signal processing and applications to planetary seismic insrumentation" supervised by Tom Pike and Danilo Mandic
- 2010-2014 MEng at Imperial College London in Electrical and Electronic Engineering
